// What will the following code output?
console.log(false == '0');
console.log(false === '0');











/* SOLUTION

The code outputs:

true
false

In JavaScript, there are two equality operators: strict equality (===) and non-strict (or weak) equality (==). 
The === operator behaves as a traditional equality operator does in most languages: 
it evaluates as true when the two expressions on either side have the same type and value. 
On the other hand, the == operator coerces the values to the same type before comparing them. 
Coercions can produce unexpected and confusing behavior. 
Thus, it's good practice to use === rather than ==. The same holds for the !== vs. != operators: prefer !==.
