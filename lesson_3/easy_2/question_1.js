// Given a string, return a new string that replaces every occurrence of the word "important" with "urgent":
let advice = "Few things in life are as important as house training your pet dinosaur.";












/* SOLUTION

advice.replace('important', 'urgent');
// => Few things in life are as urgent as house training your pet dinosaur.

Note that if the string contains two or more occurrences of important, this code only replaces the first. Can you figure out how to replace all occurrences?
